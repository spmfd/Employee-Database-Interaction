# SQL Challenge Employee Tracker

## Description

This node project is designed to help us interact with a SQL database. Not only with the creation of a database, tables, and the individual components of the tables. It also reinforced how to manipulate the tables within sql using node and javascript. With inquirer we are able to prompt the user to choose from a variety of options of tasks the tool is capable of. Once an option is selected it initiates a function. Each function interacts with the sql database, using a connection function, then uses SQL commands to manipulate the tables. 

I learned a lot when it comes to SQL tables and how great they are at not only organizing data but also how easy they are to manipulate when necessary. After doing this on a small scale I can now see why this is used by large companies to store massive amounts of data. Especially with the way you can join tables together so the manipulation of one table can have a cascading effect upon other tables. clea

## Installation

In order to run this you will need to input the following into your terminal: npm i console.table, npm i mysql2, and also npm i Inquirer@^8.2.5. Once installations are complete please login to the mysql shell and run both the schema.sql file as well as the seeds.sql file in order to populate the database and tables necessary before proceeding with running index.js.
